<h2> Organic agriculture and use of biofertilizers </h2>

<p>
In the olden days, farming was carried out in a traditional manner. Most farmers used to
have a number of farm animals in their farm and the farmyard manure generated in the farm
was used for raising crops. In addition, most of the farm-generated biomass was also used for
raising crops. No chemical fertilizers or pesticides were heard of or used. During this time
period, farmers were getting very low yield of crops, but were getting very good quality
produce. However, the yield obtained by farmers using this traditional method of farming was
not adequate to meet the food demands of the growing population. </p>

<p>
Through green revolution, India was able to meet food demands of its growing
population. Hybrid varieties of crops not only required higher inputs of chemical fertilizers,
but also were susceptible to many insect pests and diseases. This created high demand and
indiscriminate usage of pesticides and fungicides. Crops thus grown also contained high
residues of chemical pesticides which are detrimental to health.</p>

<p>
Year after year, addition of chemical fertilizers also had depleted
beneficial microbes from the soil. This, combined with lesser and lesser application of
farmyard manure, resulted in lower bioactivity of soil and crop yield.
Application of chemical fertilizers results in ground water contamination by nitrates
leaching through the soil profile. Denitrification of nitrogenous fertilizers from soil, and gases
from such process contribute to greenhouse effect/alteration of ozone layer. Most of all, a
small proportion of nitrogen, about 50% of phosphates and 100% potash are imported,
causing a strain on the foreign exchange reserve. The above scenario led agriculture into a full
circle where organic manure biofertilizers regained importance.</p>

<p>
In order to improve soil health, protect the environment, and provide nutrients to crops
in a natural way Gokulam Biotech has introduced various BioFertilizers in
</p>

<h3> Liquid formulations.</h3>
<p>
Liquid formulations of biofertilizers of Gokulam Biotech are better in terms of
virulency and shelf life than carrier - based biofertilizers or liquid broth formulations. Liquid
biofertilizers of Gokulam Biotech have a shelf life of more than one year.
