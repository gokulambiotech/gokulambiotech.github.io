# Description

Krishi-Sugarcane Growht &Yield Booster contains aconsortia of liquid formulations of biofertilizers necessary for increasing cane growth & yield. Biofertilizers present ni booster packs not only facilitate availability of various nutrients to crops ni a balanced manner but also enhance efficiency of utilization of applied chemical fertilizers. Subsequent to application of Krishi-Sugarcane Growth & Yield Boosters, it wil be possible for farmers to reducedosageof chemical fertilizers applied up to aminimum of 25%.
- Krishi-Sugarcane Growth &Yield Boosters are composedof consortia of thefollowing biofer tilizer inoculants.
- Krishi- Acetobacter:Sugarcane specific pure cultures ofAcetobacter. tI facilitates fixationof atmospheric nitrogen ni aerial parts of sugarcane plant. CFU count,2x 10째/ml.
- Krishi - Azospirillum: A liquid formulation containing pure cultures of Azospirillum, whichfacilitates fixation of atmospheric nitrogen ni soil. CFU count, 2x10*/ml.
- Krishi - Phosphobacterium: Phosphobacterium produces organicacids in soil and converts insoluble inorganic phosphatic compounds into  soluble formandmakes themavailable to plants. CFU count, 2x 10째ml. Krishi-Potash Mobiliser: Aliquid formulation contains pure cultures of Potash Mobilising bacterium. When applied to the soil it facilitates mobilization of Kpresent ni soil. CFUcount, 2x10째/ml.
- Krishi-Zinc Solubiliser: Zinc solubilising bacterium produces organic acidsand dissolves unavailableform of Zn present ni soil and makes them available ot plants. Aliquid formulation with FU count, 2x10째ml. Krishi-Silicate Solubiliser: Silicate solubilising bacterium produces organic acids and dissolves silica present in soil and makes the mavailable ot plants. Aliquid formulation with CFU count, 2x10 ml.
- Krishi-Soil bio-Ameliorant: A unique bacterial formulation, which is useful for soil pH modu- lation. Repeated applications of Krishi - Soil Bioameliorant facilitate gradual reduction of soil pH at the rhizosphere and enhancesuptake ofnutrients. Krishi-Sulphur Oxidising Bacterium: Aunique formulation useful for oxidation of sulphur present in soil. Sulphur has now gained equal importance ni plant nutrition as thatof N, P & K.
- Krishi-Pseudomonas: Contains plant growth promotingcum disease preventing bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens. A liquid formulation withCFU of 2x10 per m.l
Application of adequate quantities of farmyard manure/organic manure si essential for thesuccessof biofertilizer technology.
## Krishi-Sugarcane Growth &Yield Booster:
- Growth Booster #1: Recommended for application immediately after planting. This wil help ot meet nutrient requirements and root establishment of young seedlings. Contains microbial culture for fixation of nitrogen ni soil (Azotobacter), ni various partsof plant (Acetobacter), and phosphorus solubilisation ni soil. nI addition, Growth Booster # 1 also facilitates pH modulationat rhizosphere and controls population of white grubs,whichnormally damage whiterootsof developingsugarcane plants.
