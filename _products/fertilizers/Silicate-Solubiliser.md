### Description
For the first time, a bacterium capable of solubilising insoluble silica in soil is
introduced to the farming community. Use of Silicate Solubiliser improves silica nutrition of
plants and renders them tolerant to lodging, drought and attack by insects/pests and diseases.
Krishi-Silicate Solibiliser is a liquid biofertilizer containing pure cultures of naturally-
occuring silicate solubilising bacterium with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10 9 /ml and can be used for all
crops. Through secretion of specific organic acids, it solublises insoluble silica present in the
soil.

### Dosage
250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or app
