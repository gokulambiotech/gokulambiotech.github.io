### Description
Krishi – Rhizosphere pH Regulator is a unique product developed for soil having an alkaline
pH range.

Krishi - Rhizosphere pH Regulating Bacteria (RPHR), contains a consortia of bacteria,
(Thiobacillus sp; CFU = 2 x 10 9 per ml), which are capable of producing organic sulphuric
acid and reducing the pH of soil at the rhizosphere.

### Dosage
Krishi – RPHR is recommended up to 500 ml per acre mixed with well-decomposed
organic manure or applied in fertigation through drip irrigation system. Effective reduction of
rhizosphere pH can be achieved when Krishi- RPHR is applied along with recommended
dose of gypsum.
