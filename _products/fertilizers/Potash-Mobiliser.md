occurring soil-borne Potash Mobilising bacterium. When applied to soil, KRISHI-Potash
Mobilising bacterium multiplies, and mobilises insoluble potassium in soil. This mobilized
potassium is easily available to the plants and reduces potassium application.
KRISHI-Potash Mobiliser has CFU count of 2 x 10 9 / ml and can be used for all crops.
Since KRISHI-Potash Mobiliser is in liquid formulation, it can be easily applied to the soil or
through the drip irrigation system.

### Dosage
250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied mixed with small quantity of
well -decomposed organic manure.
