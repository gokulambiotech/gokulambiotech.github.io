### Description
For the first time, a bacterium capable of solubilising insoluble silica in soil is
introduced to the farming community. Use of Iron-and-Magnesium-Solubiliser improves silica nutrition of
plants and renders them tolerant to lodging, drought and attack by insects/pests and diseases.
Krishi-Iron-Mg Solibiliser is a liquid biofertilizer containing pure cultures of naturally-
occuring Iron-Mg solubilising bacterium with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10 9 /ml and can be used for all
crops. Through secretion of specific organic acids, it solublises insoluble silica present in the
soil.

### Dosage
