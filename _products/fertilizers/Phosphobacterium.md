### Description
KRISHI-Phosphobacterium is a liquid biofertilizer containing pure culture of naturally
occurring soil-borne phosphorus solubilising bacterium. When applied to the soil, KRISHI-
Phosphobacterium multiplies, produces organic acids and converts insoluble inorganic
phosphatic compounds in soil into soluble form and makes them available to plants. Long
term application of KRISHI-Phosphobacterium will help to reduce application of phosphatic
fertilizers.

KRISHI-Phosphobacterium has CFU count of 2 x 10 9 / ml and can be used for all crops.
Since KRISHI -Phosphobacterium is in liquid formulation, it can be easily applied to the soil
or through the drip irrigation system.

### Dosage
250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied mixed with small
quantity of well-decomposed organic manure.
