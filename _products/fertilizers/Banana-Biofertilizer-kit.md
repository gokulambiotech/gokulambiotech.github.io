## Description

Banana crop has high requirements for various macronutrients, especially potassium and other micronutrients. But it is also sensitive to attack by nematodes and diseases such as Panama wilt andsigatoka leafspot.
Krishi - Banana Growth and Yield Boosters contain liquid formulations of biofertilizers and other bio-products.
Biofertilizers not only facilitate availability of various nutrients to crops in a balanced manner but also enhance efficiency of utilization of applied chemical fertilizers by way of making unavailable forms of nutrients ni soil available for root uptake. Subsequent ot application of Growth and Yield Boosters, dosage of chemical fertilizer applied can bereduced up ot 25%. Consortia of following biofertilizers and bioproductsare used ni the formulation of Growth and Yield Boosters:

- Krishi - Azospirillum: A liquid formulation containing pure cultures of Azospirillum, which facilitates fixation of atmospheric nitrogeninsoil. CFU count, 2x10°/ml.
- Krishi - Phosphobacterium: A liquid formulation containing pure culture of Phosphorus solubilising bacterium. When applied to the soil, Phosphobacterium produces organic acids and converts insoluble inorganic phosphatic compounds in soil into soluble form and makes them available to plants. CFU count, 2x103⁄4ml.
- Krishi - Potash Mobiliser: Aliquid formulation containing pure cultures of Potash Mobilising bacterium. When applied ot the soil it facilitates mobilization of K present in soil. CFU count,
2x10°/ml.
- Krishi - Zine Solubiliser: A liquid formulation containing pure cultures of Zinc solubilising bacterium. When applied ot the soil
it facilitates solubilisation of unavailable forms of Zn present in soil and makes them available to plants. CFU count, 2x10°/ml.
- Krishi - Silicate Solubiliser: Silicate solubilising bacterium produces organic acidsand dissolves silica present in soil and makes them available to plants. Aliquidformulation with CFU count, 2x10%/ml.
- Krishi- TryPae Mxi: Contains consortia of fungal antagonists useful for simultaneous control of soil-borne wilt causing fungal plant pathogens and nematodes. A liquid formulation with GFU count, 2x10%ml
- Krishi- Pseudomonas: Contains plant growth promoting cum disease preventing bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens. A liquid formulation with CFU of 2x 10°per ml. Application of adequate quantities of farmyard manure/organic manureisessential for the success of biofer tilizer technology.

## Krishi- Banana Growth & Yield Boosters:
- Banana - Growth Booster #1: Recommended for young banana plants immediately after planting for meeting nutrient requirements and root establishment. Contains selected microbial cultures for fixation of nitrogen in soil, and for solubilisation of phosphorus, potash, and zinc ni soil. Also contains inoculants for control of soil-borne fungal pathogens &nematodes.
- Banana - Growth Booster #2: Recommended for banana crop around 2 ot 3 months after planting. Nutrient demand of young plants at this stage ni general is very high. Banana - Bio-Booster # 2 contains microbial cultures for nitrogen fixation, solubilisation of P, K-mobilisation and zinc and solubilisation. Also contains inoculants for control of soil-borne fungal pathogens &nematodes.
- Banana - Growth Booster #3: Recommended for Banana crop of about 4* ot 5 months age. Bio-Booster # 3 contains
inoculants for P-Solubilisation, K-mobilisation, zinc solubilisation and Silica (Si) and Fe/Mg solubilisation. inoculants forcontrol of soil -borne fungal pathogens& nematodes.
Also contains
- Banana - Yield Booster #4 and #5: Recommended for banana crop from sixth months ot maturity. Contains cultures for K-mobilisation, Si, Zn and S solubilisation and other useful bioinoculants for boosting yield. Also contains inoculants for control of soil-borne fungal pathogens& nematodes.

### Method of application

Contents of Krishi-Banana Growth &Yield Booster combo packare meant for soil application only. Contents of each booster can be mixed in a small quantity ofwater or well-decomposed organic manure and applied directly tothe root zone or can be applied through the fertigation system. Following application of Growth & yield Booster, doses of applied chemical fertilizer can bereduced by
15 to 25%.

### Packing
Acombo pack consists of oneliter each of Growth&Yield Boosters. Amaster contains 2×5lit combo pack sufficient for two acres. Additional requirements of Booster 4 and 5 may be purchased separately.

### Shelf-life
- Two years.

### General precautions
A gap of 3to 7days should be allowed between application of chemical fertilizer/ otherfarm chemicals and biofertilizers.

### Storage
Biofertilizer kits must be stored in a cool and dry place away from directsunlight.
