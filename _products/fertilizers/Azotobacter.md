nitrogen, but it enters the plant throught the root and fixes nitrogen in the leaves and stem of
sugarcane. CFU = 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> per ml.

### Dosage
250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied along with
well-decomposed organic manure or through the drip irrigation system. For seed treatment,
Krishi-Azotobacter can be used at the rate of 50 ml for seed material meant for planting one
acre
