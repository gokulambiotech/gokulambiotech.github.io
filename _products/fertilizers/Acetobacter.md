sugarcane. CFU = 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> per ml.

250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied along with
well-decomposed organic manure or through the drip irrigation system. For seed treatment,
Krishi-Acetobacter can be used at the rate of 50 ml for seed material meant for planting one
acre
