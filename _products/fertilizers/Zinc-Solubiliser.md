### Description
KRISHI-Zinc Solubiliser is a liquid biofertilizer containing pure cultures of naturally-
occurring soil-borne Zinc Solubilising bacterium. When applied to soil, KRISHI-Zinc
Solubiliser bacterium multiplies, secretes organic acids and helps to solubilise insoluble zinc
in soil. Zinc thus mobilized is easily available to the plants.

KRISHI-Zinc Solubiliser has CFU count of 2 x 10 9 / ml and can be used for all crops.
Since KRISHI-Zinc Solubiliser is in liquid formulation, it can be easily applied to the soil or
through the drip irrigation system.

### Dosage
250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied along with
well-decomposed organic manure.
