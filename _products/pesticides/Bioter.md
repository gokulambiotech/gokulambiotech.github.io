### Description
Krishi-Bioter is a formulation based on a consortia of entomopathogenic fungi having termiticidal properties.  CFU = 2 x 108 per ml

### Target Pests
**Krishi-Bioter** is effective for the control of termites in crop plants. Spores of the
fungus invade termiteâ€™s body,  proliferate inside the insect body, sporulate and cause death.

### Dosage and Directions for use:
Krishi-Bioter should be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre to
be dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and used for drenching the soil.

Krishi - Bioter can also be sprayed on aerial parts for controlling termite infestation on tree trunks.
