### Description
Krishi-Beevicide is a biopesticide formulation containing entomopathogenic fungus, *Beauveria bassiana* with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10^8 per ml.

### Target Pests
 Krishi-Beevicide is effective for the control of hard bodied insects such as  caterpillars, borers, beetles and grubs. Spores of the fungus invade the insect body through the cuticle and proliferate inside insect body, sporulating and causing death.

### Target Crops
Paddy, Cotton, Sugarcane, Pepper, Cardamom, Banana, Potato, Turmeric,
Ginger, Coffee, Grapes, Pomegranate, Groundnut and all vegetable crops.

### Dosage and Directions for use
Krishi-Beevicide can be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre, dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and sprayed thoroughly drenching the canopy, including underside of foliage. Spraying must be carried out during the cooler periods of the day, preferably during late evening hours.
