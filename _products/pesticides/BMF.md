### Description
Krishi- BMF is a talc-based formulation containing Pseudomonas fluorescens and other selected bacterial cultures which are antagonistic to Xantnomonas campestris p. punicae, the pathogen responsible for the bacterial blight disease of pomegranate. Krishi -BMF-WP is effective for the suppression
of Xanthomonas population in pomegranate ecosystem thereby helpful in the management of the bacterial blight disease. The selected antagonistic bacteria are grown and concentrated many times and incorporated in the formulation.
CFU count of antagonistic bacteria in Krishi-BMF formulation is more than
10 x 10<sup>15</sup> per qm.
#### Target Crops

Pomegranate and other horticultural crops.
#### Dosage and directions for use

For foliar spraying, Krishi-BMF is recommended at the rate of 3 kg (minimum) per acre at weekly or at 15 to 20 days interval depending on the severity of disease.

Required quantity of Krishi-BMF-WP should be mixed with water and after vigorous mixing the clear milky white supernatant liquid should be used for spraying of foliar parts. Spraying must be carried out during cooler periods of the day, especially after 4 PM. Periodical application of Krishi-WMF to soil will also reduce population of Xanthomonas in soil.
#### Precautions

Foliar spraying or soil application of farm chemicals such as streptomycin and other antibiotics must be avoided one week after application of Krishi - BMF - WP.
#### Shelf-life

Minimum one year from the date of manufacturing.
##### Storage
Must be stored in cool dry place at temperature less than 45C.
