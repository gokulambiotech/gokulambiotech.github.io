### Description
Krishi-Biomite is a combined biopesticide formulation based on entomopathogenic fungus, *Hirsutella thompsonii* and *Verticillium lecanii* with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10^8 per ml.
### Target Pests
Krishi-Biomite is effective for the control of mite infestation in crops especially
europhid mites in coconut. Spores of the fungus invade the soft body of the mite through the cuticle. They proliferate inside the insect body, sporulate and cause death.

### Target Crops:
Coconut, Paddy, Cotton, Sugarcane, Banana, Floriculture crops and all vegetable crops.

### Dosage and Directions for use:
Krishi-Biomite can be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre to be dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and sprayed thoroughly drenching the canopy, including underside of foliage. For control of europhid mite of coconut, Krishi-Biomite should be sprayed directly on all tender nuts. Spraying must be carried out during the cooler periods of
the day, preferably during late evening hours.
