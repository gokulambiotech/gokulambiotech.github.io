### Description
Krishi-Verelac is a biopesticide formulation based on entomopathogenic fungus, *Verticillium lecanii* with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10^8 per ml.

Krishi - Verelac can be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre, dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and sprayed thoroughly drenching the canopy, including underside of foliage. Spraying must be carried out during the cooler periods of the day, preferably during late evening hours.
