### What is Krishi - GrubGuard and how can it helps farmers to tacke white Grub problems?

Krishi-GrubGuard is a talc-based bio-product containing spore formulation of selected entomopathogenic funal organisms and is useful for the effective management of both species of grubs in soil (_Holotrichia serrata and Holotrichia consanguinea_)

Krishi-GrubGuard consists of spore formulations of known entomopathogenic fungal organisms. Spore of these microbes are able to penetrate the body of grubs where they sporulate causing grub mortality. Using advanced fermentation techniques, Krishi-GrubGuard was formulated to contain very high spore loads (CFU often more than 1015 per gm), which makes the product effective in the management of soil grubs.
