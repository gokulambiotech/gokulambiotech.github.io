### Description
Krishi-Grubkill is a combined biopesticide formulation containing Beauveria bassiana and a few other entomopathogenic fungi, with a CFU of 2 Ã— 10^8 per ml.

### Target Pests
Krishi-Grubkill is effective for the control of hardbodied insects such as caterpillars, borers, beetles and grubs. Spores of the fungus invade insect body through the cuticle and proliferate inside insect body, sporulating and causing death.

### Target Crops:
Paddy, Cotton, Sugarcane, Pepper, Cardamom, Banana, Potato, Turmeric,
Ginger, Coffee, Grapes, Pomegranate, Groundnut and all vegetable crops.

### Dosage and Directions for use:
Krishi - Grubkill can be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre, dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and sprayed thoroughly drenching the canopy, including underside of foliage. Spraying must be carried out during the cooler periods of the day, preferably during late evening hours.
