### Description
Krishi-Yes-P-Guard is a formulation based on a consortia of entomopathogenic fungi having termiticidal properties.  CFU = 2 x 108 per ml

### Target Pests

fungus invade termiteâ€™s body,  proliferate inside the insect body, sporulate and cause death.

Krishi-Yes-P-Guard should be used at the rate of 250 ml per acre to
be dissolved in 250 to 400 liters of water and used for drenching the soil.

Krishi - Yes-P-Guard can also be sprayed on aerial parts for controlling termite infestation on tree trunks.
