## Development of BioBlight:
Krishi - Bioblight is a novel research and development based bio-product for the
management of blight disease. It is based on a consortium of bio-control antagonists of
Xanthomonas such as various species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas which were selected
based on in-vitro antagonism studies. Other antagonists of Xanthomonas and their active
metabolites are also incorporated in BioBlight.

BioBlight improves plant hygiene, strengthens the defense mechanism of plants and helps
them fight against challenges posed by various diseases. It contains a blend of bacterial
antagonists of Xanthomonas with an individual CFU of 15 to 20 x 10^15 per ml. When
sprayed on the foliage, BioBlight suppresses proliferation of Xanthomonas. Periodical
foliar spraying of BioBlight at frequent intervals minimizes infection and spread of
Xanthomonas.

## Target Crops

BioBlight has been specially developed for the management of
Xanthomonas infestation in pomegranate. But it is also equally effective against soil-
borne and foliar bacterial diseases of paddy, cotton, sugarcane, pepper, cardamom,
banana, turmeric, grapes, citrus, mango, ground nut, ginger, and all vegetable crops.
BioBlight is highly successful for the management of bacterial blight disease of
pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas.

## Dosage and Directions for use
Foliar spraying of BioBlight is recommended at the rate of minimum 2 to 5 ml per liter of water. While spraying, the plant canopy must be thoroughly drenched with the spray solution. Spraying is recommended at 7 to 15 day intervals. Spraying must be carried out during the cooler periods of the day, preferably during late evening hours. Spraying of BioBlight during the resting phase of the crop is also important for suppression of Xanthomonas surviving on dry leaves and twigs. For controlling soil-borne diseases, BioBlight can be used to drench soil at the rate of 500 to 1000 ml per acre at required intervals based on severity of disease.

### Precaution
Spraying of antibiotics must be avoided 7 days before and after application of BioBlight.
Shelf-life: Krishi - BioBlight has a shelf-life of one year from the date of manufacturing.

### Packing:

Krishi - BioBlight is available in 1, 5, 20 and 50 liter containers.
Storage: Bottles of Krishi - BioBlight must be stored in a cool and dry place away from
direct sunlight.
