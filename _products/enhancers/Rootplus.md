### Description
Root Plus is a bio-stimulant containing factors capable of stimulating root development in
seedlings especially after transplantation. It contains a mixture of nutrients and metabolites of
microbial origin. Krishi - Rootplus helps seedlings to forage water and nutrients from a larger
soil area, grow uniformly and recover from transplantation shock.
Target Crops: Rootplus is highly recommended for transplanted crops particularly vegetable
crops like tomato, chili, capsicum, and other horticultural crops.

### Dosage
Krishi - Rootplus is recommended at the rate of 250 to 500
ml/acre at frequent intervals following transplantation. Rootplus can also be applied through
fertigation. Small quantity of Rootplus can also be applied to seedling trays a few days before
transplantation.
