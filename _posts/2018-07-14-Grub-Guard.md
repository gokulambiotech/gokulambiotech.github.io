for the management of white grubs in soil.

Krishi-GrubGuard is one of the most successful products available in the market for the control of grubs. Most soil of the sugarcane belt of Kolhapur district in Maharastra State in India is heavily infested with white grubs and pose a major threat to sugarcane cultivation.

### What are White Grubs and how do they damage crops?

Soil grubs pose a major problem to field crops such as sugarcane, turmeric, ginger, soybeans, groundnut, strawberry and other crops. They infest the rhisosphere and eat the tender roots and stems of crops.

White grubs of _Holotrichia serrata_ and _Holotrichia consanguinea_ beetles (Order: Coleoptera; Family: Scarabaeidae) are commonly known to cause major damage to field crops.  

### Life Cycle of White Grubs:

The life cycle of beetles in soil consists of the egg stage, a few stages of grubs, pupa and adult beetles. Freshly developed white roots are eaten by grubs causing heavy mortality to germinating seeds and transplanted seedlings. In general, the egg stage lasts for about 8 to 30 days, larval stage about 56 to 292 days, and pupal stage about 10 to 35 days.

All stages of life cycle of the beetle are spent in soil. Based on soil temperature, grubs of Holotrichia beetles are able to make vertical movement in soil, thus posing challenges to various control measures.

### Management of White Grubs in soil: Role of Gokulam Biotech

Through research and development, scientists at Gokulam Biotech have been successful in developing a bio-package for the management of white grubs, called Krishi-GrubGuard.
