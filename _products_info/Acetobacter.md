description: KRISHI-Azospirillum is a beneficial soil-borne bacterium capable of fixing considerable quantity of nitrogen in soil. This bacterium, when applied to soil, multiplies in billions and absorbs atmospheric nitrogen and fixes it in the root zone of soil.
While addition of urea gives readily available form of nitrogen to the plant, Azospirillum slowly improves soil nitrogen status by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Addition of well- decomposed organic manure is very important for multiplication of Azospirillum. Repeated
addition of Azospirillum will help to reduce application of nitrogenous fertilizers. KRISHI-Azospirillum has CFU count of 2 x 10 9 / ml and can be used for all crops. Since KRISHI-Azospirillum is in liquid formulation, it can be easily applied to soil or through the drip irrigation system.
Dosage: 250 ml per acre in adequate quantity of water or applied mixed with small quantity of well-decomposed organic manure
